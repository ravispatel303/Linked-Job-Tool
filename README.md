Chrome Web Extension - LinkedIn Job Tool

The LinkedIn Job Tool is a web extension that will provide relevant information for job seekers on LinkedIn Jobs.
The extension provides the following features:

1. Highlights the sponsorship status(Relevant to Non-Immigrants in the United States):
    If the employer mentions about sponsorship in the job description, then it will highlight on the page.
    Red Color - If the employer is not willing to provide sponsorship.
    Green Color - If the employer provides sponsorship.
    Yellow Color - If nothing is mentioned in the job description about sponsorship.
    
2. Highlights the job requirements(work experience):
    If the employer describes previous work experience in the job description then it will appear on the page like 2+ years experience.
    Also, some of the job requirement skills will highlight too like programming languages.
    Highlighted Color - Purple
    
3. Tracks the job links:
    Clicking on web extension will open a new tab that shows all the LinkedIn jobs visited links.
    Note: The web extension must remain ON. For the records copy the page(Ctrl + A/Command + A) and save it on local storage. 

4. Alerts the user:
    If the Job link is visited twice or more then an alert box will appear stating "You've already visited this page before."
